            <h2>My first years</h2>
            <p>As a little kid I started playing piano inspirated from my brother.<br> But he stoped shortly after. I had a little keyboard,<br> witch would be enough for now<br> I participated at a course provided in school.<br>Every time I got back from school I played the piano.<br>But soon enough i noticed i needed a biger piano<br>I dreamt of a big white E-Piano, and would you belive that? I got one for my birthday.<br>with this awesome new Piano I played every day until now.  </p>
